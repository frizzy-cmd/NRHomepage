    "Due to Niko having many features and similarties to a cat, (probably is!), other characters in the game often confuse Niko for one, which Niko has to consistently and repeatedly deny.",
    "Niko's favorite food is pancakes, with hazelnuts grinded into the batter.",
    "Alula and Calamus are siblings from The Glen.",

    "Niko is technically 'not a cat,' despite having cat-like features, cat eyes, ears, and whiskers!",
    "You can make Niko ride on a roomba in one of the apartment rooms in The Refuge.",
    "The Prophet Bot in the Barrens waited a 'very long' time for the Messiah to arrive.",
    "Plight (the lamplighter) works tirelessly to maintain the streetlights in The Refuge (surface).",
    "Ling runs the cafe in The Refuge, and also serves pancakes! Although, not hazelnut pancakes.",

    "Kip is one of the people who have a complicated order when ordering from the cafe, but tips really well afterwards.",
    "Rue is a fox who remembers your previous game runs.",

    "Niko is referred to using they/them pronouns in the OneShot: World Machine Edition bio and trailer.",
    "Niko's name was orginally 'Nico', chosen because it was a gender-neutral name, It was changed to 'Niko' after Nightmargin realized the name could be a reference to Nikola Tesla and his work on lightbulbs.",

    "At one point during a Solstice run, Niko makes '*confused cat noises*', So much for being a cat, huh?",
